# Job Applier 1000

The job market is so bad, it is time to bring home the big guns.
The Job Applier 1000 is a noble and brave warrior that will help you automate your job application process.

The way it aims to do it is quite different from what you might expect. It will not apply to jobs for you, but it will help you apply to jobs faster.
It accepts and stores your resume in it's global context.
Then, it is up to you to *search* for jobs and *apply* to them.
However, the Job applier will help you and make you faster in 3 ways:

- Optimize your resume for the job you are applying to
- Create a cover letter for the job you are applying to
- Print out a small document containing common questions and answers for the job you are applying to so you can copy paste them in the application form.

This way, the hope is that a person will be able to apply to more jobs in less time.
Since the job market is now nothing but a numbers game, the more you apply, the more chances you have to get a job.
